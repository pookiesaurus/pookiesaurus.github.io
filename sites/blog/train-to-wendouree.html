        <h1>The Train to Wendouree</h1>
        <p>By Ryan</p>

        <h2>ACT I: departure</h2>
        <p>I entered the train to Wendouree at Southern Cross 20 minutes before its departure. Getting on I noticed a few groups of young white kids, who were being loud and carrying bottles of alcohol: cruisers and a mystery green alcoholic drink. One of these hooligans was this young white boy, who admittedly looked especially dull, and three young girls, of which I could not care to distinguish from one another. This train had three carriages, and they were spread out amongst them.</p>
        <p>At this point in time, I was just walking through the cabins, to the last cabin, which was closest to the Caroline Springs Station exit. These 20 or so minutes before departure were quite uneventful, as in retrospect, I could have never imagined what was to come.</p>
        <p>Just before the train left southern cross, they all congregated to the middle of the carriage I was in, which amidst their clamour was ironically named the quiet cabin. A small woman, a v/line employee, was walking from one end of the cabin to the other end, into the conductor’s room, clearly noting their presence. One of the delinquents screamed at her “we’ll be good we promise”. Now I stifled a chuckle at this, for of course drunken promises once spoken were law, and drunk people keep their promises.</p>
        <p>Now that they were altogether, I could place them more easily. Amongst them were a few young teenagers, who I would assume to be in middle school to high school, and a woman old enough to be their mother. Now this was an odd combination, drunk teenagers of varying ages, some clearly children, and a woman who hasn’t got her life together. Before I could observe any more, the train had left the station.</p>
